### Project Name: **Diabetes Prediction Web App**

---

### **README**

#### **Overview**
This project is a **Diabetes Prediction Web App** built using **Streamlit**, a popular Python library for creating web applications. The app uses a **RandomForestClassifier** machine learning model trained on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** to predict whether a patient is diabetic or not based on their health metrics. The app also provides visualizations to compare the patient's data with the dataset.

---

### **Features**
1. **User Input**: Patients can input their health metrics using sliders in the sidebar.
2. **Prediction**: The app predicts whether the patient is diabetic or not.
3. **Visualizations**: Interactive graphs compare the patient's data with the dataset.
4. **Accuracy**: Displays the accuracy of the model on the test dataset.

---

### **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web app.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning (RandomForestClassifier).
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.

---

### **Dataset**
The dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which contains the following features:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration.
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function.
- **Age**: Age in years.
- **Outcome**: Target variable (0 = non-diabetic, 1 = diabetic).

---

### **How It Works**
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded using Pandas.
2. **Model Training**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a RandomForestClassifier is trained.
3. **User Input**: The user inputs their health metrics using sliders in the sidebar.
4. **Prediction**: The trained model predicts whether the user is diabetic or not.
5. **Visualization**: Graphs are generated to compare the user's data with the dataset.
6. **Output**: The app displays the prediction and model accuracy.
